            <h3>Brain Cancer:</h3>
                <p>Tumors in any part of the brain might increase the pressure inside the skull (known as intracranial pressure). 
                    This can be caused by growth of the tumor itself, swelling in the brain, or blockage of the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). 
                    Increased pressure can lead to general symptoms such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Headache</li>
                        <li>Nausea</li>
                        <li>Vomiting</li>
                        <li>Blurred vision</li>
                        <li>Balance problems</li>
                        <li>Personality or behavior changes</li>
                        <li>Seizures</li>
                        <li>Drowsiness or even coma</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Headaches that tend to get worse over time are a common symptom of brain tumors, occurring in about half of patients. 
                        (Of course, most headaches are not caused by tumors.)
                    As many as half of people with brain tumors will have seizures at some point. 
                    The type of seizure may depend on where the tumor is. Sometimes this is the first sign of a brain tumor, 
                    but fewer than 1 in 10 first seizures are caused by brain tumors.</p>
